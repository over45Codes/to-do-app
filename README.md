## Summary

This application was a step-up from the previous one I built (digital-clock-app) and it was certainly more challenging due to the creation ul and li elements dynamically using JavaScript, also adding fun styling to the buttons. Added Local Storage, this was very involved, definitely a fun & challenging project!
